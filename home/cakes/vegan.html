						<p><u><b>Ingredients for Vegan Sponge Cake</b></u></p>
						<ul><b>For the Cake:</b>
							<li>150g dairy-free spread, plus extra for the tins</li>
							<li>300ml dairy-free milk, we used oat milk</li>
							<li>1 tbsp cider vinegar</li>
							<li>1 vanilla pod, seeds scraped</li>
							<li>300g self-raising flour</li>
							<li>200g golden caster sugar</li>
							<li>1 tsp bicarbonate of soda</li>
						</ul>
						<ul><b>For the filling:</b>
							<li>100g dairy-free spread</li>
							<li>4 tbsp jam, we used strawberry</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div style="top:10px" class="methods">
						<p><b><u>Method</u></b></p>
						<ol>
							<li>Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Line the bases of 2 x 20cm sandwich tins with baking parchment and grease with a little of the dairy-free spread.</li>
							<li>Put the dairy-free milk into a jug and add the vinegar, leave for a few minutes until it looks a little lumpy. Put half of the vanilla seeds and all the other cake ingredients into a large bowl then pour over the milk mixture. Using electric beaters or a wooden spoon, beat everything together until smooth.</li>
							<li>Divide the mix between your two tins then bake in the centre of the oven for 30-35 mins or until a skewer inserted into the middle of the cakes comes out cleanly. Leave them in their tins until cool enough to handle then carefully turn out onto wire racks to cool completely.</li>
							<li>While the cakes are cooling, make the filling. To make the vegan buttercream, whisk or beat together the dairy-free spread, icing sugar and remaining vanilla seeds until pale and fluffy. Dairy-free spreads do vary so if the spread you are using is quite soft try to avoid using electric beaters. Stir the ingredients together instead to avoid overworking it. However, if the mixture is too firm, use electric beaters to help lighten it and add 1-2 tbsp of dairy-free milk when whisking.</li>
							<li>Spread the jam onto one of the cooled sponges, top with the buttercream then place the other sponge on top. Dust the assembled cake with a little icing sugar or caster sugar before slicing.</li>

						<p><u><b>Ingredients for Vegan Birthday Cake</b></u></p>
						<ul>
							<li>320ml sunflower oil , plus extra for the tins</li>
							<li>450ml soy , almond or coconut milk (the pouring variety, not a can)</li>
							<li>1 tbsp apple cider vinegar</li>
							<li>500g light muscovado sugar</li>
							<li>2 tsp vanilla extract or vanilla bean paste</li>
							<li> 260g plain soy or coconut yogurt</li>
							<li>450g self-raising flour</li>
							<li>160g cocoa powder</li>
							<li>1½ tsp baking powder</li>
							<li> 1½ tsp bicarbonate of soda</li>
						</ul>
						<ul><b>For the Vegan Buttercream</b>
							<li> 200g dairy-free dark chocolate</li>
							<li> 400g vegan spread , at room temperature</li>
							<li> 2 tsp vanilla extract or vanilla bean paste</li>
							<li> 800g icing sugar , sifted</li>
							<li> colourful sprinkles (make sure they are suitable for vegans)</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div style="top:12px" class="methods">
						<ol><u><b>Method</b></u>
							<li>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Oil three 20cm round cake tins and line the bases and sides with baking parchment. Whisk the milk and vinegar together in a jug – the milk should curdle slightly. Set aside.Whisk the sugar, oil and vanilla extract together in a bowl, then whisk in the yogurt, making sure to break down any sugar lumps. Pour in the soured milk and mix well. Sift the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda and ½ tsp salt into a separate bowl and stir well to combine. Gradually whisk the wet ingredients into the dry until you have a smooth batter, but be careful not to over-mix.</li>
							<li>Divide the batter evenly between the tins and bake for 25-30 mins, until well risen and springy, and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out almost clean.Leave the cakes to cool in their tins for 20 mins, then carefully turn them out onto a wire rack to cool completely. </li>
							<li>For the buttercream, melt the chocolate, and leave to cool. Beat the spread and vanilla until pale and fluffy. Add the icing sugar gradually,until the mixture is light and creamy. Pour in the cooled chocolate and combine thoroughly. Chill the buttercream for at least 30 mins before using.</li>
							<li>To assemble the cake,trim the tops off the sponges to make them level. Put one sponge aside and spread over a layer of the buttercream, using a palette knife to get an even, neat finish. Top with the second sponge and spread over another layer of buttercream.</li>
							<li>Top with the last sponge upside-down, so the bottom of the cake becomes the top.Spread the sides of the cake with buttercream.Once you have the sides covered as neatly as you can, cover the top with a thin layer of buttercream. Use your palette knife to neaten the top and sides. If you have a side scraper, use it to sweep around the sides and top to sharpen the coating. Put the cake in the fridge to firm up and chill for 1-2 hrs.</li>
							<li>To finish, cover the sides and top of the cake in the same manner, using most of the remaining buttercream. Press the sprinkles up against the bottom of the cake, about a quarter to a third of the way up.Keep the cake in the fridge to stay firm, then remove 1 hr before serving. </li>

						<p><u><b>Ingredients for Vegan Cupcakes with banana and peanut butter</b></u></p>

						<p><b><u>Method</u></b></p>
						<ol>
							<li>Heat oven to 170C/150C fan/gas 31⁄2. Line muffin tins with 16 cases. In a bowl, combine the flour, sugar, 1⁄2 tsp salt and bicarbonate of soda. In a second bowl or a jug, mix the mayonnaise, mashed bananas and vanilla extract. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and mix with a spoon until just combined (don’t overmix or your cupcakes will be heavy). Spoon the mixture into the cases and bake for 20 mins.</li>
							<li>When the cupcakes come out of the oven, sprinkle the chocolate chips over – they will melt and then harden again, so don’t touch them</li>
							<li>For the icing, combine the vegan margarine and icing sugar in an electric mixer, then add the vegan milk and continue to mix on a slow speed until completely combined. Turn the mixer up and combine for a further 3 mins. Finally, stir in the peanut butter. Pipe or simply spread the icing on top of the cakes. Store in an airtight container and eat within 2 days.</li>

						<p><u><b>Ingredients for Rainbow Cake</b></u></p><br>
						You'll need 3 x these ingredients for six sponges
						<ul>
							<li>125g butter, softened, plus a little extra for the tin</li>
							<li>225g plain flour</li>
							<li>150g golden caster sugar</li>
							<li>3 medium eggs (very important to use the correct size)</li>
							<li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
							<li>pinch of salt</li>
							<li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
							<li>edible food colouring - red, orange, yellow, green, blue and purple, plus optional pink (see below)</li>
						</ul>
						<ul><b>For the icing:</b>
							<li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
							<li>750g soft cheese or mascarpone</li>
							<li>350g icing sugar</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div style="top:10px;" class="methods">
						<ul><u><b>Method</b></u>
							<li>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Butter 2 x 20cm round sandwich tins and line the bases with baking parchment. Tip all the sponge ingredients, apart from the food colouring, into a mixing bowl, then beat with an electric whisk until smooth.</li>
							<li>Working quickly, weigh the mixture into another bowl to work out the total weight, then weigh exactly half the mixture back into the mixing bowl. Pick two of your colours and stir a little into each mix. Keep going until you are happy with the colour – the colour of the batter now will be very similar to the finished cake, so be brave! Scrape the different batters into the tins, trying to spread and smooth as much as possible – but try not to waste a drop of the batter – a rubber spatula will help you. Bake on the same oven shelf for 12 mins until a skewer poked into the middle comes out clean.
							</li>
							<li>Gently turn the cakes out onto a wire rack to cool. Wash the tins and bowls thoroughly, and start again from step 1 – this time using another two colours. Unless you’re making the optional pink layer, repeat one more time to get 6 sponges, all of different colours. Leave them all to cool.</li>
							<li>To make the icing, very briefly beat the vanilla and soft cheese or mascarpone with an electric whisk until smooth. Sift in the icing sugar and gently fold in with a spatula. Be careful – the more you work it, the runnier it will get, increasing the chance of splitting.</li>
							<li>Smear a little icing on your cake stand or plate – just a splodge to stick the first sponge. Start with the red, then spread with some icing right to the very edge. Repeat, sandwiching on top the orange, yellow, green, blue and finally purple sponges. Spread the remaining icing thickly all over the sides and top of the cake.

						<p><u><b>Ingredients for Mermaid Cake</b></u></p>
						<ul>
							<li>300g butter , softened, plus extra for the tins
							</li>
							<li>300g caster sugar</li>
							<li>5 large eggs , beaten</li>
							<li>1 tsp vanilla bean paste</li>
							<li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
							<li>300g self-raising flour</li>
							<li>purple gel food colouring (or a mixture of purple, blue and red gel colouring)</li>
						</ul>
						<ul><b>For the icing</b>
							<li>700g icing sugar</li>
							<li>350g butter , softened</li>
							<li>Blue or purple gel food colouring</li>
							<li>edible pearls and silver sprinkles, or extra optional decoration</li>
						</ul>
						<ul><b>For the mermaid tails(or use shop-bought fondant mermaid tails)</b>
							<li>200g white chocolate</li>
							<li>200g white chocolate</li>
							<li> 2 tsp gold or metallic lustre (see tip below)</li>
							<li>You will need
								mermaid tail mould and small shell moulds, available online</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div style="top: 10px;" class="methods">
						<ol><b><u>Method</u></b>
							<li>If you're making the mermaid tails, melt the white chocolate in a heatproof bowl in 20-second bursts in the microwave, stirring after each turn. Pour into the tail moulds and small shells, and put on a small tray flat in the freezer for 15-20 mins until set. You can repeat this for four tails if you only have one mould.Once set, remove from the mould, mix the lustre with ¼ tsp of water and paint it onto the mermaid tails (see tip, below). Put back on a plate or tray in the freezer until needed. </li>
							<li>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Butter and line the base of three 18cm sandwich cake tins with baking parchment. Beat together the butter, sugar, eggs, vanilla, baking powder and flour until you have a fluffy mix.</li>
							<li>Divide the mixture evenly between three bowls and mix a few drops of colouring into each bowl until fully combined, making each bowl a different shade of purple, getting lighter. Pour each coloured sponge mix into separate tins and smooth over the tops. Bake for 25-30 mins. After 10 mins, remove the cakes from their tins and transfer to a cooling rack, top-side facing down, and leave to cool.</li>
							<li>While the cake is cooling, make the icing. Beat together the icing sugar and butter until pale and fluffy, mixing in 1 tbsp warm water to loosen the mixture if necessary. Set half of the icing aside in a bowl. Divide the other half of the icing between three bowls and colour each a different shade of blue, a dark, medium and light. Stack the sponges, spreading most of the white icing over each one using a palette knife, then use the palette knife to roughly coat the outside of the cakes with the remaining white icing to create a crumb coat. Chill for 30 mins. </li>
							<li>Put each of the blue icing shades in separate piping bags and cut a large 2cm hole at the bottom. Starting with the dark shade at the bottom of the cake, pipe an even ring onto the whole cake, two-three times around. Continue working your way up the cake with the icing getting lighter as you reach the top of the cake. Using a small palette knife, work your way around the join in between each row, gently pushing to join each line together. Save some icing in the piping bags to decorate the top. Smooth over the cake with a large palette knife or cake scraper to create a smooth ombre icing, keeping the excess to decorate the top. </li>
							<li>You can either mix all the leftover icing together and put in a clean piping bag with a star nozzle to get a multicoloured effect, or pipe individual shades on the top. Add a few dots around the top of the cake in the varying blue colours to look like waves (using some of the white to look like the top of a crashing wave), and dot around the pearls, sprinkles, shells and mermaid tails, pushing them into the icing on the side of the cake, and on top to finish.</li>
